            <h1 id="section1"> The Lips</h1>
            <p class = "centered"> "Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely." <br>
                – Song of Solomon 4:3 <br>
                The lips, revered as a canvas for expression and allure, are cherished across cultures and eras. <br>
                In ancient Egypt, red ochre was used to stain lips, symbolizing vitality and power. Cleopatra <br> famously enhanced her lips to emphasize her allure. <br>

            <h2> What Makes For Attractive Lips? | Defining What Makes A Face Attractive</h2>
            <p> The lips form a transition zone between the facial skin and the oral mucosa (inner wall of the mouth) and are a significant aesthetic feature of the face as studies have shown that observers of a face instinctively focus 
                most on the lips, eyes and nose. Molded by historical and cultural forces—from the beauty ideals of Ancient Greece and Egypt to the allure celebrated in Modern Western culture—the lips embody sensuality and elegance. <br>
                The harmonious interplay of the various components of the lips elevates and refines one's appearance.

            </p>

            <h2 id="section2"> Lip Proportions </h2>

            <p>             
                Aesthetic lips are imbued with numerous subtle signals that reflect underlying aspects of health, youthfulness, and other biological determinants of attractiveness, which in turn define judgments of desirability and allure.
                The foundation of aesthetic lips is built upon lip proportions. After all, the achievement of a delicate harmony of proportions is rooted in global beauty standards.
                These proportions should align with an individual’s overall facial structure, integrating with the broader contours of the face. <br>
                The following scientific framework simply provides a structured explanation for what people inherently recognize as attractive in their environment.<br><br>

                        <h3>Relative Lip Proportions </h3>
                        <p> Aesthetic lip proportions are linked to the following: <br>
                            Upper Vermillion: Upper visible lip (red part) <br>
                            Lower Vermillion: Lower visible lip (red part) <br>
                            Upper Lip :From the bottom of the nose to upper vermillion <br>
                            Lower Lip: From the bottom of the lower vermillion to the chin <br> 

                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> A range of lip measurements serve as references for assessments of facial aesthetics, with some of the measurements often being evaluated in terms of absolute linear measurements compared with population norms. 
                Accounting for ethnic differences, population-specific norms provide a benchmark for determining whether lips fall within a natural, attractive range.
                Someone might not articulate that they prefer lips that fit population norms, but instinctively find lips that "blend well" as attractive when the lips' size and shape fit cultural norms internalized.
                Absolute measurements ensure the lips' size stay within these norms, preventing exaggeration.
                <br>
                Hence, the absolute size of attractive lips align with the majority of those within the same ethnic group.
                <br><br>
                Beyond the absolute size of the lips, the relative relationships for the different parts of the lips define its charm.
                As repeatedly emphasised, beauty is rooted in proportions. It should come as no surprise that well-proportioned upper to lower lips are more important than absolute lip heights. <br><br>

                Exploring the relative lip proportions that maximise aesthetics, we arrive at our first finding: The most attractive Upper Lip height (measured from nose to upper vermillion border) 
                relative to the Lower Lip height (measured from lower vermillion border to chin) is 1:2 (Kempta et al., 2023). This finding deduced the ideal position of the lips relative to the nose and chin. 
                <i> See Lip Proportions & Relative Position</i><br>
                Given this ideal ratio being grounded in universal principles of balance and harmony, the 1:2 ratio attained from a Caucasian-based study is an aesthetic ratio that can be reasonably extrapolated for cross-cultural applications.

            </div>
            <p> The prominent redness of the lips comes to mind when the lips are mentioned, so how should the visible red part of the lips be proportioned?
                General scientific consensus across cultures answers it like this: the lower lip should be slightly larger than the upper lip, with ratios typically ranging from 1:1.3 to 1:1.6.
                Simply speaking, the lower vermillion should generally be 1.3 to 1.6 times the size of the upper vermillion (Farkas, 1994; Rhee et al., 2015). However, variation in cultural preferences should be noted. <br><br>

                Caucasians favour a fuller lower lip relative to the upper lip, adhering to the 1:1.6 "golden ratio" (Farkas, 1994);
                Asians prefer more similarly-sized upper and lower vermillion, often closer to ratios of 1:1 to 1:1.3 in terms of height (Farkas et al., 2005);
                African populations find fuller lips overall culturally and naturally common, with ratios from 1:1 to 1:1.2 (Farkas et al., 2005).
                Despite nuances, there is a general agreement that the lower vermillion should be larger than the upper, as this is perceived to contribute to balance, youthfulness, and attractiveness. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of fullness of the lips, women typically show more of the red part of their lips (vermilion) compared to the rest of their (non-visible) lip height (Anic-Milosevic et al., 2010). Biologically, larger, fuller lips
                develop under the influence of higher levels of oestrogen (Farkas 1981; Fink and Neave 2005).
                This creates a more prominent, noticeable lip appearance, often associated with femininity and beauty. 
                Anthropometric studies have shown that wider and fuller lips in relation to facial width as well as greater vermilion height contribute to female attractiveness (Farkas et al., 1987).
                Even so, robust, pouty lips are considered to be sexually attractive in both males and females (Sarnof & Gotkin, 2012). 
                Naturally full lips are a biological beauty standard indicating youth and fertility.

            </p>
            <h2 id="section3"> Lip Projection </h2>
            <p> The aforementioned proportions are not the only components of attractive lips. How the lips join together also affect its geometric harmony.
                When at rest, the space between the lips, known as the interlabial gap, typically ranges from 0 to 3 millimeters, The lips should seal properly during resting position and an interlabial gap of greater than 4 mm is usually an
                indication of an incomplete lip seal.

                Misaligned lips detract from aesthetics and hinder function. Incomplete lip seal can arise from both lip protrusion and lip retrusion, which are both contingent on the upper jaw (maxillary) development.
                The phenomena of lip protrusion and lip retrusion are summarised below: <br><br>
                Lip Retrusion is characterised by the appearance of "pulled back" or recessed lips often due to retraction of the maxilla (upper jaw), weakness or underdevelopment of the perioral muscles (around the mouth) and aging, 
                where the lips become thinner and lose volume. <br>
                Lip Protrusion, characterised by excessive outward extension of the upper or lower lips, occurs due to forward positioning of the maxilla, hyperactivity of the lip muscles orncreased lip volume or tissue <br>

            <p> Lip projection is a reflection of one's dentofacial development (i.e. growth of teeth, jaws and facial bones), as abnormal lip projection alludes to the presence of orthodontic issues. 
                Orthodontic issues refer to problems with the alignment of the teeth, jaws, and bite. These issues, which can aslo harm relative lip proportions, primarily stem from improper development of the upper or lower jaw, as well as teeth structure. <br>


                To illustrate, an overbite (Class II malocclusion) where the upper jaw is protrusive, causes the lips to appear forward (Proffit et al., 2018) in order to compensate for the misalignment (Chaconas & Sattler, 1991).
                Similarly, an underbite (Class III Malocclusion) leads to a more pronounced chin and often, a retruded upper lip (Proffit et al., 2018). <i> Learn more about attractive dentofacial structure & habits to facilitate proper facial development under the Dentofacial Structure Section.</i> <br><br>
                Certain oral habits like thumb-sucking or tongue-thrusting can alter the development of the dental arches, leading to lip protrusion over time (Bishara, 1998).
                Improper development of the underlying skeletal structure (i.e. dentofacial growth) often affects a myriad of important aesthetic facial features, with the lips being one of them.
                Visually pleasing lips are thus indicative of proper facial development. <br><br>

            <p> Protrusive or retrusive lips are not only determined by the evaluation of lip prominence with respect to the chin, nose and overall facial profile. It is also compared with population means within the same ethnic group. 
                Different ethnicities are predisposed to have different degrees of lip protrusion. Namely, <b> people of African descent</b> tend to have more <b> protrusive lips than Caucasians</b>, whereas <b>Native Americans and East Asians</b> lie more

                        <h3><br> Short Philtrum </h3>
                        <p> The philtrum is too short since the mouth corners are further away, resulting in an inverted arc.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> In this regard, the philtrum just above the red part of the upper lip (vermillion) may seem insignificant, but has major consequences on one's satisfaction with their facial aesthetics.
                Cosmetic surgery patients' discontent with their lips is often due to a combination of a long philtrum and thin lips (Sito et al., 2019). 
                This unhappiness may be attributed to the fact that long philtrums are associated with aging as they do in fact lengthen with age. The philtrum can increase up to 6mm over time. <br><br>
                This, however, does not mean that shorter philtrums are sure to increase attractiveness. A vertically short philtrum relative to the corners of the mouth hinders both function and facial aesthetics.
                This phenomenon tends to result in a snout-like appearance, impacting the curvature of the lips. <i>See Short Philtrum above. </i><br> The visual differences are apparent.

            </p>

            <p> Congruent with the concept of facial harmony, the philtrum tends to be proportionate to the length of the face. Given the variety of face shapes, shorter philtrums tend to complement shorter face shapes and longer philtrums suit longer faces.
                On average, the ideal philtrum should be 12- 15mm (〜1/2 inch) tall (Shin et al., 2014; Hasibuan et al., 2024; Ding, 2021) across a range of ethnic groups. These values find cross-cultural agreement, representing the optimal range which maximises proper balance.
                Males tend to have philtrums lying on the higher end of this range compared to females, given their tendency to have broader, taller more masculine face shapes. <br><br>

                Besides the philtrum length, its visibility impacts social percepion and beauty.
                Less noticeable and defined philtrums causes faces to seem older and less attractive (Nunes & Bran, 2021). This may come as a surprise for individuals harbouring insecurities about having a defined philtrum.
                A defined philtrum is prominent and noticeable, but rather than drawing attention away from other features and upsetting balance, it adds definition to the face and enhances the appearance of the lips.
                Furthermore, a philtrum with clear ridges adds to facial symmetry, thus being a generally desirable trait. While preferences for a more defined philtrum align with traditional beauty standards as noted by scientific literature, 
                the lack of philtrum definition should not be a concern for aesthetic reasons simply because the natural variation in philtrum shapes adds to the uniqueness and diversity of facial features. Philtrum definiton, alone, acts more 
                like a delicate accent or a subtle decoration to the face.

            <p> The image above features Kristen Stewart who the general public associates with having a resting b**** face (RBF)—a neutral facial expression that unintentionally appears angry, annoyed, or unapproachable—as coined by social media. 
                A major factor is due to how the oral commissures are positioned. Other well-known figures who have also been deemed to have 'RBFs' share this feature of downturned oral commissures.

                Neutral and upturned mouth corners are generally favoured (Wollina & Goldman, 2022). Downturned mouth corners, when made intentionally, usually convey negative emotions, such as sadness or disapproval (Duncan, 2004). Hence, an individual's resting face naturally having downturned oral commissures 
                elicits an impression of being unfriendly and less approachable. Though not necessarily a dealbreaker for an attractive face, people with this feature tend to look older, more tired and meaner (Thuy-Van T Ho et al., 2019; Sluis et al., 2022) compared to those with upturned or neutral oral commissures.
                
                For those who want to avoid having downturned oral commissures, it is important to understand that the mouth corners tend to become more downturned due to a combination of factors like sleep deprivation (Sundelin et al., 2013), aging,
                muscle weakening, loss of skin elasticity, the effects of gravity and dental changes (Sarnof & Gotkin, 2012). Understanding this allows us to target the root causes using natural, non-invasive methods such as the following:

    <h2 id="section5"> Lip Shapes </h2>
        <p> Most people instinctively think of the Cupid's bow when discussing lip shapes. <br>
            This shape is formed when the peaks of the bow coincide with the philtral columns, giving a prominent bow appearance to the lip. It is outlined with the vermilion border, which connects the lip skin to the facial skin.

                        <p> The Cupid's bow is a facial feature where the double curve of a human upper lip is said to resemble the bow of Cupid, the Roman god of erotic love.

        <p> The presence of a Cupid's bow or lack thereof highlights how youthful one is.<br> With the lips flattening and its distinct Cupid's bow shape being lost with age, a well-defined cupid signals youth (Wollina, 2013). <br>
            A visually pleasing Cupid's bow should slant upwards from the mouth corners to the Cupid's peak gently at an angle between 10-20° (Wollina, 2013). <br>
            Social media and cultural influences have glamorised and popularised certain lip shapes. Moreover, cosmetic retailers have put forth common templates to help consumers identify their own lip shape, which can be condensed into the following guide:

        <p> Different lip shapes evoke different impressions—some exude sensuality, while others enhance a youthful or elegant appearance.
            Heart-shaped lips allude to playfulness and charm; fuller lips create a pouty look, enhancing sensuality and youthfulness whereas narrower lips contribute to a more delicate and refined appearance. Aesthetic clinics suggests that fuller lips pair well with longer faces and wide lips with wide faces. 
            Moreover, wide lips tend to add structure and enhance expressiveness, with positive assoctions to perceived confidence and charisma. This impact of increasing expressiveness may be evidenced by perceptions of a 
            broad smile being more attractive than a narrow one (Profitt et al., 2013). <br><br>

            These classifications created often act as an aide for consumers of makeup for a more personalised experience. <br><br>

            Nevertheless, the importance of lip shape in facial aesthetics is often secondary to lip position and projection. The lips are a central feature of the lower face, but the shape of the lips, on its own, simply adds finesse to the lips' appearance
            so long as it is not overly thick or overly thin.
            
        </p>

    
        <h2 id="section6"> Lip Colour </h2>
        <p> One's natural lip colour stems from genetic and environmental factors (e.g. sun exposure based on geographic location). African, Hispanic, and South Asian descent tend to have higher levels of melanin, which results in 
            darker lips (van der Meij & van der Laan, 2008).
            Conversely, those with European or East Asian ancestry typically have lighter skin tones with lower melanin levels, leading to lighter pink or peach-colored lips (Tomas-Roca et al., 2018).
            
            The colour of the lips definitely matters in attractiveness, as demonstrated by the saturation of today's beauty market with an entire spectrum of shades and tints for lips, tailored to suit diverse skin tones and ethnicities. 
            Yet, the main consumers are mostly women. Does this mean that the colour of one's lips as a determinant of physical attractiveness is gender-specific? <br><br>

            No, the color of men's lips do influence attractiveness, as it is an important visual cue for health, vitality, and genetic fitness, all of which contribute to perceived attractiveness.
            Lips with a healthy reddish or pinkish tone are often perceived as a sign of good blood circulation and overall health. Pale lips may signal anemia or illness, while overly dark lips 
            can sometimes be associated with dehydration or smoking-related effects (Stephen et al., 2009). 
            From an evolutionary perspective, subtle redness in lips may signal youthfulness and vitality, traits that are associated with reproductive fitness. 
            This healthy 'subtle reddish' undertones might appear as darker shades of brown, plum, or reddish-brown rather than a pale pink or red for those with darker lips (Stephen et al., 2009)
            Excessively bright red lips, however, deviate from cultural norms of "natural" male attractiveness (Etcoff, 1999).
            Increased luminance contrast between the facial features (lips and eyes) and the skin serves to reduce masculinity and attractiveness of male faces whereas it enhances the youthfulness, femininity and attractiveness of female faces (Stephen & McKeegan, 2010).

        <p> Red lips have been considered attractive in women in geographically and temporally diverse cultures, possibly because they mimic vasodilation associated with sexual arousal (Bullivant et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 2004; Lynn et al., 2007).
            When lipsticks are used to achieve this effect, it is not so much the particular shade of red that matters, but rather the facial contrast created without overwhelming the skin complexion.
            Soft pinks, coral shades, and light peach complement fair skin (Tomas-Roca et al., 2018); Rose, mauve and medium reds best highlight the natural depth of medium skin tones; Deeper shades of red enhance the richness of dark skin for a bold
            contrast, giving a vibrant, defined look (van der Meij & van der Laan, 2008). </p>
            
        <h2 id="section7"> Conclusion </h2>
        <p> Rather than glorifying overfilled lips tinted in an overrated shade, it is more valuable to focus on the lips' natural position, proportions and overall health.
            The lips are a health indicator—pointing to orthodontic problems that can be improved on, as well as reflecting lifestyle habits. 
            Facial attractiveness is strongly correlated to health, so take care of yourself and your lips will reflect that.
            The consistent implementation of what may seem like insignifcant habits—adopting better posture, staying hydrated, sleeping sufficiently, eating well, avoiding smoking, implementing sun protection, lip exfoliation, moisturising and managing stress—is
            nothing short of transformative!
