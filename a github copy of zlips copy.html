            <h1 id="section1"> The Lips</h1>
            <p class = "centered"> "Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely." <br>
                – Song of Solomon 4:3 <br>
                The lips, revered as a canvas for expression and allure, are cherished across cultures and eras. <br>
                In ancient Egypt, red ochre was used to stain lips, symbolizing vitality and power. Cleopatra <br> famously enhanced her lips to emphasize her allure. <br>

            <h2> What Makes For Attractive Lips? | Defining What Makes A Face Attractive</h2>
            <p> The lips form a transition zone between the facial skin and the oral mucosa (inner wall of the mouth) and are a significant aesthetic feature of the face as studies have shown that observers of a face instinctively focus 
                most on the lips, eyes and nose. Molded by historical and cultural forces—from the beauty ideals of Ancient Greece and Egypt to the allure celebrated in Modern Western culture—the lips embody sensuality and elegance. <br>
                The harmonious interplay of the various components of the lips elevates and refines one's appearance.

            </p>

            <h2 id="section2"> Lip Proportions </h2>

            <p>             
                Aesthetic lips subtly convey health, youthfulness, and allure, reflecting universal signals of attractiveness. 
                The key lies in achieving balanced proportions that harmonize with the overall facial structure, complementing the natural contours of the face. While rooted in global beauty standards, these principles mirror what we instinctively find appealing.
                <br><br>
                Attractive lips are often assessed through both absolute size and proportional relationships, with population-specific norms offering benchmarks for what feels naturally appealing. 
                While individuals may not consciously favor lips that align with these norms, they instinctively find well-balanced, culturally harmonious lips attractive. 
                Absolute measurements <b>ensure lips remain within natural, unexaggerated ranges typical of one’s ethnic group</b>.

                    <p> Aesthetic lip proportions are linked to the following: <br><br>
                        Upper Vermillion: Upper visible lip (red part) <br><br>
                        Lower Vermillion: Lower visible lip (red part) <br><br>
                        Upper Lip :From the bottom of the nose to upper vermillion <br><br>
                        Lower Lip: From the bottom of the lower vermillion to the chin <br><br>

                  </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> 
                However, proportions matter more than size alone. <br>The balance between the upper and lower lip plays a defining role in lip aesthetics. 
            </p>

            <div class="book-section">
                <div class="bookx">

                  <div class="book-detailsx">
                    <p> Research highlights an ideal upper-to-lower lip height ratio of 1:2 (Kempta et al., 2023), where the upper lip complements the lower in harmoniously.
                        <br> Grounded in universal principles of balance, this ratio—though derived from Caucasian studies—transcends cultural boundaries, offering insights into timeless beauty ideals. <br><br><br>
                        
                        
                        When we think of lips, the vibrant red vermilion often comes to mind. <br>
                        Scientifically, the <b>most attractive proportion is when the lower lip is slightly larger than the upper</b>, with a ratio of 1:1.3 to 1:1.6 (Farkas, 1994; Rhee et al., 2015). 
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Cultural preferences influence these proportions:

                <br> - Caucasians favor the "golden ratio" of 1:1.6, with a noticeably fuller lower lip (Farkas, 1994).
                <br> - Asians prefer more balanced upper and lower lips, with ratios around 1:1 to 1:1.3 (Farkas et al., 2005).
                <br> - African populations naturally exhibit fuller lips, favoring ratios between 1:1 and 1:1.2 (Farkas et al., 2005). <br><br>
                Despite cultural variations, a slightly larger lower vermilion is universally linked to balance, youthfulness, and attractiveness.
            
            Lip fullness also plays a significant role in beauty. Women tend to display more visible vermilion compared to the non-visible lip height, a feature influenced by higher estrogen levels (Farkas, 1981; Fink & Neave, 2005). 
            This biological trait enhances femininity and creates a striking, prominent lip appearance. Studies show that wider and fuller lips, with greater vermilion height relative to facial width, contribute to female attractiveness (Farkas et al., 1987). 
            Well-defined vermillion borders are also attractive (Popenko et al., 2017;  Heidekrueger et al., 2017).
            <b>Interestingly, pouty, robust lips are perceived as sexually appealing in both men and women (Sarnof & Gotkin, 2012).</b>
            <br> Even so, natural looking lips are still preferred by some over augmented fullness (Popenko et al., 2017).  Naturally full lips best signify youth, fertility, and beauty.

            </p>
            <h2 id="section3"> Lip Projection </h2>


            
            <p> Attractive lips are not just about proportions; how the lips come together also plays a crucial role. <br> The space between the lips at rest, called the interlabial gap, ideally ranges from 0 to 3 millimeters. 
                <br> If this gap exceeds 4 mm, it indicates an incomplete lip seal, which can detract from aesthetics and hinder function. Proper lip closure is key for aesthetics, thus, any misalignments detract from attractiveness.
                <br><br>

                  <div class="book-detailsx">
                    <p> <br>Lip Misalignment Types: <br><br>
                        Lip Retrusion: Lips appear "pulled back" or recessed, often caused by underdeveloped or retracted maxilla, weak mouth muscles, or aging, which thins the lips and reduces volume. <br><br>
                        Lip Protrusion: Lips extend excessively outward, often due to forward maxilla positioning, overactive lip muscles, or increased lip volume or tissue. <br><br>

                        Misalignment often stems from the positioning of the upper jaw (maxilla) <br><br>

                        To illustrate, an overbite (Class II malocclusion) where the upper jaw is protrusive, causes the lips to appear forward (Proffit et al., 2018) in order to compensate for the misalignment (Chaconas & Sattler, 1991). <br><br> 
                        
                        Similarly, an underbite (Class III Malocclusion) leads to a more pronounced chin and often, a retruded upper lip (Proffit et al., 2018).

            <div>
            <p>  Both conditions—lip protrusion and retrusion—often trace back to suboptimal maxillary development, which is the foundation for balanced and attractive lip projection. <br>
                <b>Lip projection is a reflection of one's dentofacial development</b> (i.e. growth of teeth, jaws and facial bones). Abnormal lip projection (and sometimes even lip proportions) alludes to the presence of orthodontic issues (misalignment of the teeth, jaws, and bite).

                <br><br>
                Certain oral habits like thumb-sucking or tongue-thrusting can alter the development of the dental arches, leading to lip protrusion over time (Bishara, 1998).
                Improper development of the underlying skeletal structure (i.e. dentofacial growth) often affects a myriad of important aesthetic facial features, with the lips being one of them.
                Visually pleasing lips are thus indicative of proper facial development. <br><br>

            <p> Protrusive or retrusive lips are not only determined by the evaluation of lip prominence with respect to the chin, nose and overall facial profile. It is also compared with population means within the same ethnic group. 
                Different ethnicities are predisposed to have different degrees of lip protrusion. Namely, <b> people of African descent</b> tend to have more <b> protrusive lips than Caucasians</b>, whereas <b>Native Americans and East Asians</b> lie more
                towards the <b>other end </b>. <i>Learn more about ethnic differences under Cultural Beauty Standards. </i><br>Hence, when lips are projected in a way that deviates too far from ethnic-specific norms, they detract from the overall facial aesthetics.

            <h2 id="section4"> Lip Contour</h2>
            <p> Lip contour refers to the curvature and definition of the lips, which determines how you are perceived when your lips are at rest. 
                 
            </p>

                  <div class="book-detailsx">
                    <p> In terms of contour, the philtrum—the area between the nose and the upper lip—plays a surprisingly important role in facial aesthetics. <br><br>
                        The philtrum ridges are the vertical lines running from the base of the nose to the upper lip.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Dissatisfaction with lip appearance experienced by cosmetic surgery patients mostly stems from a combination of a long philtrum and thin lips (Sito et al., 2019). This is because longer philtrums are linked to aging, as they can lengthen by up to 6mm over time. 
                        
                        <br><br>However, shorter philtrums are not universally better. When disproportionately short relative to the mouth,
                        it creates a "snout-like" appearance, disrupting lip curvature and overall balance. <br>

            <p> 
                <b>The ideal philtrum length reflects overall face shape</b>: shorter philtrums complement shorter faces, while longer philtrums suit longer faces, maintaining a balanced proportion. 
                On average, the optimal length is 12–15mm (Shin et al., 2014; Hasibuan et al., 2024; Ding, 2021), a range supported across diverse ethnic groups. Males often have slightly longer philtrums, aligning with their taller, 
                more masculine faces. 
                <b>A defined philtrum with clear ridges enhances symmetry, adds definition, and creates a youthful appearance</b> (Nunes & Bran, 2021). While some worry that a prominent philtrum draws attention away from other features, it actually complements the lips and boosts facial harmony
                and diversity to facial features, which should be celebrated. While a well-defined philtrum is often associated with traditional beauty standards, the absence of pronounced ridges is not inherently unattractive. <br><br>
                
                
                Instead, <b>a philtrum acts as a subtle accent, like a decoration</b> that enhances the face's harmony without overpowering its natural character.
                Ultimately, the philtrum enhances facial balance and aesthetics, but its natural variation highlights the unique beauty of every face. <br><br></p>

                            A major factor is <b>downturned mouth corners</b> (oral comissures), with other well-known figures deemed to have 'RBFs' sharing this feature. Downturned mouth corners are often associated with negative emotions.

            <p> Neutral or upturned mouth corners are generally seen as more attractive and approachable (Wollina & Goldman, 2022). In contrast, downturned corners often convey sadness or disapproval (Duncan, 2004), 
                giving a resting face an unfriendly, tired, or older appearance (Thuy-Van T Ho et al., 2019; Sluis et al., 2022). While not a dealbreaker for attractiveness given how models can be seen having downturned oral comissures, this feature can subtly impact perceptions of approachability.
                Factors like aging, weakened muscles, reduced skin elasticity, sleep deprivation (Sundelin et al., 2013), gravity, and dental changes contribute to downturned corners over time (Sarnof & Gotkin, 2012).
                Fortunately, understanding these causes opens the door to natural, non-invasive solutions for a more balanced and refreshed appearance. <br><br>

            This shape is formed when the peaks of the bow coincide with the philtral columns, giving a prominent bow appearance to the lip. It is outlined with the vermilion border, which connects the lip skin to the facial skin.

                        <p> The Cupid's bow is a facial feature where the double curve of a human upper lip is said to resemble the bow of Cupid, the Roman god of erotic love.

        <p> The presence of a Cupid's bow or lack thereof highlights how youthful one is.<br> With the lips flattening and its distinct Cupid's bow shape being lost with age, a well-defined cupid signals youth (Wollina, 2013). <br>
            A visually pleasing Cupid's bow should slant upwards from the mouth corners to the Cupid's peak gently at an angle between 10-20° (Wollina, 2013). <br>
            Social media and cultural influences have glamorised and popularised certain lip shapes. Moreover, cosmetic retailers have put forth common templates to help consumers identify their own lip shape, which can be condensed into the following guide:

        <p> Different lip shapes evoke different impressions—some exude sensuality, while others enhance a youthful or elegant appearance.
            Heart-shaped lips allude to playfulness and charm; fuller lips create a pouty look, enhancing sensuality and youthfulness whereas narrower lips contribute to a more delicate and refined appearance. Aesthetic clinics suggests that fuller lips pair well with longer faces and wide lips with wide faces. 
            Moreover, wide lips tend to add structure and enhance expressiveness, with positive assoctions to perceived confidence and charisma. This impact of increasing expressiveness may be evidenced by perceptions of a 
            broad smile being more attractive than a narrow one (Profitt et al., 2013). <br><br>

            These classifications created often act as an aide for consumers of makeup for a more personalised experience. <br><br>

            Nevertheless, the importance of lip shape in facial aesthetics is often secondary to lip position and projection. The lips are a central feature of the lower face, but the shape of the lips, on its own, simply adds finesse to the lips' appearance
            so long as it is not overly thick or overly thin.

        <h2 id="section6"> Lip Colour </h2>
        <p> One's natural lip colour stems from genetic and environmental factors (e.g. sun exposure based on geographic location). African, Hispanic, and South Asian descent tend to have higher levels of melanin, which results in 
            darker lips (van der Meij & van der Laan, 2008).
            Conversely, those with European or East Asian ancestry typically have lighter skin tones with lower melanin levels, leading to lighter pink or peach-colored lips (Tomas-Roca et al., 2018).
            
            The colour of the lips definitely matters in attractiveness, as demonstrated by the saturation of today's beauty market with an entire spectrum of shades and tints for lips, tailored to suit diverse skin tones and ethnicities. 
            Yet, the main consumers are mostly women. Does this mean that the colour of one's lips as a determinant of physical attractiveness is gender-specific? <br><br>

            No, the color of men's lips do influence attractiveness, as it is an important visual cue for health, vitality, and genetic fitness, all of which contribute to perceived attractiveness.
            Lips with a healthy reddish or pinkish tone are often perceived as a sign of good blood circulation and overall health. Pale lips may signal anemia or illness, while overly dark lips 
            can sometimes be associated with dehydration or smoking-related effects (Stephen et al., 2009). 
            From an evolutionary perspective, subtle redness in lips may signal youthfulness and vitality, traits that are associated with reproductive fitness. 
            This healthy 'subtle reddish' undertones might appear as darker shades of brown, plum, or reddish-brown rather than a pale pink or red for those with darker lips (Stephen et al., 2009)
            Excessively bright red lips, however, deviate from cultural norms of "natural" male attractiveness (Etcoff, 1999).
            Increased luminance contrast between the facial features (lips and eyes) and the skin serves to reduce masculinity and attractiveness of male faces whereas it enhances the youthfulness, femininity and attractiveness of female faces (Stephen & McKeegan, 2010).

        <p> Red lips have been considered attractive in women in geographically and temporally diverse cultures, possibly because they mimic vasodilation associated with sexual arousal (Bullivant et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 2004; Lynn et al., 2007).
            When lipsticks are used to achieve this effect, it is not so much the particular shade of red that matters, but rather the facial contrast created without overwhelming the skin complexion.
            Soft pinks, coral shades, and light peach complement fair skin (Tomas-Roca et al., 2018); Rose, mauve and medium reds best highlight the natural depth of medium skin tones; Deeper shades of red enhance the richness of dark skin for a bold
            contrast, giving a vibrant, defined look (van der Meij & van der Laan, 2008). </p>
            
        <h2 id="section7"> Conclusion </h2>
        <p> Rather than glorifying overfilled lips tinted in an overrated shade, it is more valuable to focus on the lips' natural position, proportions and overall health.
            The lips are a health indicator—pointing to orthodontic problems that can be improved on, as well as reflecting lifestyle habits. 
            Facial attractiveness is strongly correlated to health, so take care of yourself and your lips will reflect that.
            The consistent implementation of what may seem like insignifcant habits—adopting better posture, staying hydrated, sleeping sufficiently, eating well, avoiding smoking, implementing sun protection, lip exfoliation, moisturising and managing stress—is
            nothing short of transformative!
