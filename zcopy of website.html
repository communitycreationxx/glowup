    <p> <b>If you are 16-24 </b> and your reflection makes you feel less confident, desperately wanting to look like those conventionally attractive people you see everywhere - on TikTok, Instagram, and in movies... then it's crucial to take action now. 
        These are the most formative years for maximizing your facial attractiveness, and the choices you make today can significantly impact your appearance for years to come. <br>

        This site is here to guide you to become conventionally attractive by societal standards, through natural means. <br><br> 
        <b>Imagine this is your one and only life </b>, do you want to live with an unremarkable, or even unappealing appearance? It is not your fault that self-limiting beliefs convinced you that your looks are 90% genetics, 
        with little room for transformation, given society's portrayal of beauty as an inborn trait. Yet, people vastly underestimate the environmental and lifestyle factors that impacts facial development, symmetry, proportions,
        facial definition, and other universal hallmarks of beauty. 

        Don't believe me? Copy and paste this question into ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, or any other advanced AI model: <br><br>

        <i>For one to be physically attractive, how would you score the relative importance (in terms of percentages) of 1. genetics and 2. environmental and lifestyle factors? Lifestyle factors being those within one's control (whereby the individual
        is not required to go under the knife), such as posture, nutrition and diet, as well as self-care, to facilitate the natural development of facial structure and features to be conventionally attractive. 
        Leverage the scientific literature and relevant resources available to you. </i><br><br>

        Were you surprised that responses ranked the relative importance of lifestyle and environmental factors at up to 40 or 50%? <br><br>

        Still don't believe me? Look at these transformations: <br><br><br>

        While your preference for attractive faces are influenced by culture and social media, all attractive faces, irrespective of race, adhere to a baseline. They follow universal, overarching concepts of beauty - facial harmony, youthfulness, symmetry, averageness, leanness.
        The universal, cross-cultural determinants of beauty are all reflections of health - beauty is health. 
        Being attracted to beautiful faces happens subconsciously as it is a biological instinct to find a high quality mate. <br><br>

        Here, we define and put into words what the mind subconsciously evaluates for an attractive face, interpreting science-based findings to
        create a comprehensive, easily-understandable glow up guide. <br><br>

        We don't enforce a one-size-fits-all beauty ideal. Instead, we account for the unique beauty standards shaped by culture, gender, and ethnicity, helping you achieve a more holistic and individualized impact on your glow-up.
